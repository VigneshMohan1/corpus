Animal-free agriculture consists of farming methods that do not use animals or animal products.[1] Animal-free growers do not keep domesticated animals and do not use animal products such as farmed animal manures or animal parts (bone meal, blood meal, fish meal).[2] Emphasis is placed on using green manures instead.Animal-free farming may use organic or non-organic farming techniques. However, most detailed discussions of animal-free agriculture currently focus on animal-free organic variants.[3]

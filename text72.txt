An agriculture ministry (also called an agriculture department, agriculture board, agriculture council, or agriculture agency) is a ministry charged with agriculture. The ministry is often headed by a minister for agriculture.Specific duties may relate to regulation, promotion, agricultural research, price supports and agricultural subsidies, plant diseases and invasive species. Some countries have multiple agriculture ministries, devoting entire ministries to more specific policy areas such as forestry and fisheries; rural affairs; food and food quality, security, and safety; consumer protection; and matters relating to the environment.
